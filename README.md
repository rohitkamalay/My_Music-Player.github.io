# My Music-player
This repository includes an HTML and CSS-based music player web application. To structure the Music Player Web application, I utilised HTML. There are two pages in this music player. These two pages are styled with CSS. This programme is only a demo; there is no database to save these music there. When a user clicks on one of the popular artist photographs, a second page is redirected, and if they click on the name of the music programme, they are returned to the original page.
